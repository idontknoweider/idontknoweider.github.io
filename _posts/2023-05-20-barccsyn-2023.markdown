Hello! I am Eider and I will attend (or am attending (or attended)) the BARCCSYN 2023 conference. There, I present [this work](../resources/BARCCSYN2023_poster.pdf) on brain states and forced transitions.

I am affiliated with the Computational Neuroscience Group in the Centre for Brain and Cognition at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra

My poster is number 45! Titled **Towards data-driven brain stimulation target discovery using single-subject whole brain models**.

If you had trouble when reading my poster (colours, font size, it was not clear, etc.) and you want to help me improve, please, send me a message at eider.perezordoyo(at)upf(dot)edu!

For more information, a more detailed explanation of the methods and more references regarding my work, please, check out my Ph.D. [research proposal](../resources/Research_proposal.pdf)
